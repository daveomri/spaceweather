    "- SWPC provides averaged integral electron flux (electrons/(cm^2 s sr)) with energies grater than 0.8 MeV and greater than 2 MeV. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The radiation belt electron fluxes vary dramatically over time scales raging from minutes to years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abrupt increases and decreases in flux can oxxur due to reconfigurations in the magnetosperic magnetic field, as well as due to various particle acceleration and loss mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When measured at geostationary orbit, the lectron fluxes also exhibit a substantion spatial variability, independent of the temporal changes due to magnetic field reconfiguration and particle accelerations/loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The electron fluxes at geostationary orbit typically have their highest values near local noon and their lowest values near local midnight.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This spatial feature is due to the structure of the magnetospheric magnetic field, strong at noon and weak at midnight, causes by the pressure of the solar wind on the day side of the magnetosphere."
